<a href="https://catalogue.ualberta.ca/Course/Details?subjectCode=ECE&catalog=422&previousTerms=True" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>This course</span></a> 
introduces students to software system reliability engineering and computer security, in two six-week 
modules. In the system reliability module, we will examine the similarities and differences between reliability 
engineering for hardware systems and for software systems, and techniques for achieving software reliability. 
Software fault tolerance mechanisms will be the main focus. In the computer security module, we will examine the 
potential threats to computer system security, and controls for protecting computer systems against both malicious 
and non-malicious compromise. By its nature, computer security extends beyond the domain of software, and encompasses 
the entire environment in which a computer system is embedded. Therefore, this module will examine both software and 
non-software threats and controls.
