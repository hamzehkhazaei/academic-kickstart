This course is intended to teach students the fundamental concepts that underlie operating systems, including 
multiprogramming, concurrent processes, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, file systems, protection and 
security. Many examples from real systems are given to illustrate the application of particular concepts. At the end of 
this course, a student will be able to understand the principles and techniques required for understanding and designing 
operating systems.
