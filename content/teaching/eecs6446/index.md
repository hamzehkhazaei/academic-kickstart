Coming Soon.   
In distributed systems, one can choose from a variety of load balancing policies, a wide range of migration policies, 
capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies, etc. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions 
before investing the time and money to build a system. This course introduces students to stochastic and queuing 
modeling to answer the above questions.
